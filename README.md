It is similar to "Quora"

In this project react is used for the frontend, firebase for the backend, redux for state management tool and Material-UI for icons, react-modal for question and answer box.
When a question/answer is posted by a user the name of the user and the time and date on which the quesio/answer was posted would get displayed as well as it would get stored in the firebase database with the user's email who has posted with the date and time, questions and the answers will get stored in different collections.
It also has a login-logout functionality where one can login through either their google account or with some another email-password.
